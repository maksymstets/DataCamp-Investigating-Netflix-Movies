# DataCamp-Investigating-Netflix-Movies
## Exploratory data analysis project from DataCamp
Exploratory data analysis on the netflix_data.csv data to understand more about movies from the 1990s decade.

What was the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s? Save an approximate answer as an integer called duration (use 1990 as the decade's start year).

A movie is considered short if it is less than 90 minutes. Count the number of short action movies released in the 1990s and save this integer as short_movie_count.

## Additional analyses:

Duration distribution: Create a histogram of movie durations in the 1990s\
Genre analysis: What were the top 5 most common genres in the 1990s?\
Trend over time: How did average movie duration change year by year in the 1990s?\
Country comparison: Which country produced the most 1990s movies in the dataset?\
